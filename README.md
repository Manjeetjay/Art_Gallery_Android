Art Gallery Android
This is my first android project that I made with no help from anyone. I followed some instructions from the developers.android.com websiteâ€™s Basic Android course.

Description
This app is an art gallery that shows you pictures of art. You can click buttons at the bottom of the screen to move to the next or previous artwork. You can also zoom in and out of the images by pinching the screen.

Installation
To install this app, you need to have Android Studio installed on your computer. Then, you can clone this repository using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/Manjeetjay/Art_Gallery_Android.git
